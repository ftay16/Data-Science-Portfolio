# Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio! 
This repository serves not only to showcase my data science projects, but to also document my journey and growth in the Data Science field. 
And hopefully inspire someone along the way, where you could be a young gun just starting out or an old soul looking to transition.

# Table of Contents
Project 1: Food Delivery Recommendation
- Description: In this project, I performed exploratory data analysis on Food delivery order dataset to clean and understand the data. Next, I implemented a User-based Collaborative Filtering Recommendation Model to recommend customers new cuisines based on historical food orders of similar customers.
- Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Sklearn.

Project 2: SQL Demonstration
- Description: In this project, I converted my Movies dataset from pandas dataframe to SQL engine. I performed several SQL queries to demonstrate my understanding of (1) CTEs to make SQL code more readable, (2) joins between multiple tables using keys and (3) sound logic to get the correct results in SQL.
- Tools Used: Python, Pandas,SQL, sqlalchemy

More projects are on the way, happy exploring!
