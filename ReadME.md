# Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio! 
This repository serves not only to showcase my data science projects, but to also document my journey and growth in the Data Science field. 
And hopefully inspire someone along the way, where you could be a young gun just starting out or an old soul looking to transition.

Project 1: Food Delivery Recommendation

More projects are on the way, happy exploring!
